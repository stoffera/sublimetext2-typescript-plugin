sublimetext2-typescript-plugin
==============================

**TypeScript integration in SublimeText that goes beyond syntax highlight.**

### Project Goal

* TypeInferrences, the editor can tell you the type of a variable
* As-you-type inline type errors
* Auto completions calculated from type inferrences

The idea is to harness the functionality provided by the TypeScript language services provided by Microsoft. By integrating Sublime Text with these services we hope to get up and running TypeScript in SublimeText.

## Work in Progress

The project state at this moment leaves many implmentations yet to be done. **We do not recommend you to install the plugin, as it might crash Sublime Text**. We will of course announce when we have a working prototype or beta version running.
